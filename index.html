            <h1>How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety: And Abstinence, Drugs, Satanism, and Other Dangers That

            <h4> The Cats of America are under siege!</h4>
            <p>Long gone are the good old days when a cat’s biggest worries were mean dogs or a bath. Modern cats must
                confront
                satanists, online predators, the possibility of needing to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and
                countless other threats to their nine lives.

                For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have stood at the vanguard of our country's
                defense
                by helping to prepare our nation's cat owners for the difficult conversations they dread having with
                their pets.
                Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety answers crucial questions such
                as,
                “What is the right age to talk to my cat about the proper use of firearms?” and “What are the benefits
                of my cat
                living a lifestyle of abstinence?” and especially “Why does my cat need to use the internet? Can’t he
                just play
                with yarn like cats used to do?”

                Our country—and our cats—stand at a precipice. It will take courage, and it will take hard work, but
                armed with
                the knowledge within these pages, we can make our cats—and America—great again!</p>
